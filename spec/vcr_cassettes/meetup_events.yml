        this the after party of our monthly SD Ruby UCSD meetings. <br \/>\n\n <br
        \/>\n\n On the third Thursday of every month, we get together at Monk Development
        for a gathering of Ruby minds over some beers and laptops. Bring your projects,
        questions, ideas, and favorite six pack of beer to share with the clan. <br
        \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n For those who would prefer a more focused approach, we
        usually hack on an open source project. <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n We have white
        boards, tables, chairs and a foozball table. The vibe is informal and the
        outcome is unpredictable. This hackfest is open to all so whether you''re
        new to Ruby or a total guru, please join us and help grow the community. :)
        <br \/>\n\n <br \/>\n\n Feel free to e-mail me with any more questions: etdebruin
