# SD Ruby

This app is the website of [SD Ruby](http://sdruby.org), a local Ruby user group based in San Diego, CA.

Currently, this application includes support for our video podcast, member signup and registration, member profiles, and a Github project list. We're also working on adding other features.


## System Dependencies ##

### Ruby ###

This app is designed to run on Ruby 1.9.3.

### ImageMagick ###

To work best, you must have ImageMagick installed on your local machine:

* For Linux, install using a package manager such as aptitude: `aptitude install imagemagick`
* For Mac OS X, install this via homebrew: `brew install imagemagick`

## Installation ##

``` shell
bundle install                                          # Install project dependencies
cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml      # Configure your database(s)
cp config/app_config.example.yml config/app_config.yml  # Configure your application settings
cp config/.env.sample .env                              # Configure your env
rake sunspot:solr:start                                 # Start Solr search engine
rake db:migrate db:seed                                 # Setup database and load sample data
rake sunspot:solr:reindex                               # Index the database
rails s                                                 # Start Rails server
```

Note: You will need to add your AWS credentials and Meetup API key to `config/app_config.yml`.

## Running Tests ##

``` shell
rake db:test:prepare # if this is your first time running the tests
rspec spec
```

Tests can also be run automatically using [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) watchers. In order to begin watching files, simple start Guard using the `guard` command.

Please be sure to run the tests and ensure all are passing before issuing a pull request!

## Deployment ##

You can deploy to the staging or production Heroku apps, if you have the appropriate permissions, using one of the following commands:
``` shell
rake staging deploy commit=BRANCH
rake production deploy
```

Deployment tasks will automatically run any pending migrations.

## Features ##

### Podcast ###

Thanks to UCSD, we're able to record SD Ruby meetings, and publish our talks as a [video podcast](http://sdruby.org/podcast).

The podcast code can generate both an Atom feed and an RSS feed (with custom iTunes RSS extensions).

### Member Guide ###

The [member guide](http://sdruby.org/users) contains a list of all SD Ruby members.

Member profiles can include:

* Full name
* Avatar image
* Github ID
* Neighborhood
* Ruby experience
* Work availability
* Contact email (if public)

### Project List ###

The [list of projects](http://sdruby.org/projects) shows all Github projects created by SD Ruby members.
